What is Up-casting in Java?

-> Upcasting can be considered as a programming scenario where the reference of a Parent class
can hold the object of the child class. A subclass object is treated as an instance of its 
superclass

Think of it as a large box can contain small box inside it.

We can achieve Upcasting it as the format
Parent reference-variable = new Child();
