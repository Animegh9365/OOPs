Methods in Interfaces:


1/ Abstract Methods:

Methods declared in interfaces are implicitly public and abstract.


Abstract: Methods in interfaces are abstract because they don't have implementation body.
Public: Methods are accessible to everywhere.

Example: 

interface Player {
    void play();  //This is actually : public abstract void play();
    void stop();  //This is actually : public abstract void stop();
}


2/ Default Methods (introduced in Java 8):
	
	Default methods allow us to define a method with a default implementation body within an 
	interface. These methods can be modified by the implementing classes.
	
	Example:
	
	interface Player {
    void play();
    void stop();
    default void pause() {
        System.out.println("Playback paused.");
    }
}

3/ Static Methods (introduced in Java 8):
	
	Static methods belongs to the interface not the instance of the class. They can be called on
	the interface itself.
	
	Example: 
	 interface Player {
    static void reset() {
        System.out.println("Player reset to default settings.");
    }
}
