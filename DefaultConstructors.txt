What are default constructors in Java?

A default constructor in java is a no argument constructor that is automatically provided by
the compiler if no constructors are specified by the developer.

When we create a class that do not have any constructors, Java assumes we need a basic constructor
to create instance of the class. The automatically provided constructor is called the default
constructor.

Example:

class Bicycle {
    int gear;
    int speed;

    // No constructor is defined by the programmer.
}

public class TestBicycle {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Bicycle myBike = new Bicycle();  // Using the default constructor provided by Java
        System.out.println("Gear: " + myBike.gear + ", Speed: " + myBike.speed);  // Outputs: Gear: 0, Speed: 0
    }
}


Key Characteristics of Default Constructors
Initialization: The default constructor initializes instance variables to default values (0 for numbers, null for object references, and false for booleans).

Accessibility: If the class is public, the default constructor is also public.

Simplicity: It does not perform any operations except initializing the object.
