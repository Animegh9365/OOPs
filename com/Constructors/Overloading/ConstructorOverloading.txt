Constructor overloading in Java allows to have multiple constructors in the class. But with 
different parameters. This is useful when we want to initialize objects in different states
or with different initial values.

Benefits of Constructor Overloading
Flexibility: Enables the initialization of objects in different configurations, catering to 
various needs and scenarios.

Clarity and Readability: Each constructor’s parameters clearly define what information is 
required for the object’s creation, making the code easier to understand and use.

Customization: Different constructors can set up an object in completely different states, 
providing great flexibility within the same class structure.


Best Practices
Keep it Simple: Avoid overloading with too many constructors as it can make the code hard to maintain. Instead, focus on a few key configurations that are actually beneficial.

Clear Documentation: Each constructor should be well documented to explain what it does and the parameters it requires.

Constructor Chaining: Where appropriate, use constructor chaining to maximize code reuse and minimize redundancy.
